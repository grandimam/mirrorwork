**Summary:** 4 jobs (1 offer, 1 interviewing, 1 rejected, 1 saved)

───────────────────────────────────────
**Quick actions**

→ `/mirrorwork tracker update <job-id> --status applied`
→ `/mirrorwork tracker update <job-id> --stage coding`
→ `/mirrorwork tracker update <job-id> --outcome passed`
```

### `/mirrorwork tracker update <job-id> --status <status>`

Update a job's status:

1. Read `activity/tracker.md`
2. Find the row matching job-id (company-role pattern)
3. Update the status
4. If status is `applied`, set Applied date to today
5. If status is `interviewing`, prompt for stage if not set
6. Save the file

**Valid statuses:**
- `saved` — Job analyzed, not yet applied
- `applied` — Application submitted
- `interviewing` — In interview process
- `offered` — Received offer
- `accepted` — Offer accepted
- `rejected` — Application rejected
- `withdrawn` — You withdrew

**Example:**
```
/mirrorwork tracker update stripe-staff-backend --status interviewing
```

Output:
```
✓ Updated stripe-staff-backend → interviewing

What stage are you at?
```

Use **AskUserQuestion**:
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What interview stage are you at?",
    "header": "Stage",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Phone screen", "description": "Initial recruiter/hiring manager call"},
      {"label": "Coding", "description": "Technical coding interview"},
      {"label": "System design", "description": "System design interview"},
      {"label": "Behavioral", "description": "Behavioral/culture fit interview"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

### `/mirrorwork tracker update <job-id> --stage <stage>`

Update the interview stage:

**Valid stages:**
- `phone` — Phone screen / recruiter call
- `coding` — Coding interview
- `system-design` — System design interview
- `behavioral` — Behavioral / culture fit interview
- `hiring-manager` — Hiring manager interview
- `final` — Final round / offer discussion

**Example:**
```
/mirrorwork tracker update stripe-staff-backend --stage system-design
```

Output:
```
✓ Updated stripe-staff-backend → stage: system-design

Tip: After the interview, update the outcome:
→ `/mirrorwork tracker update stripe-staff-backend --outcome passed`
```

### `/mirrorwork tracker update <job-id> --outcome <outcome>`

Update the outcome of the current stage:

**Valid outcomes:**
- `pending` — Waiting for result
- `passed` — Moved to next round
- `failed` — Did not pass this round

**Example:**
```
/mirrorwork tracker update stripe-staff-backend --outcome passed
```

Output:
```
✓ Updated stripe-staff-backend → outcome: passed

What's the next stage?
```

If outcome is `passed`, ask about next stage:
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What's the next stage?",
    "header": "Next",
    "options": [
      {"label": "System design", "description": "System design interview"},
      {"label": "Behavioral", "description": "Behavioral interview"},
      {"label": "Hiring manager", "description": "Hiring manager chat"},
      {"label": "Final round", "description": "Final decision round"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

If outcome is `failed`, auto-update status to `rejected`:
```
✓ Updated stripe-staff-backend → outcome: failed
✓ Status updated to rejected

───────────────────────────────────────
📝 **Learning opportunity**

What went wrong in this round? Recording this helps future prep.
```

### `/mirrorwork tracker note <job-id> <note>`

Update the "Notes" column:

```
/mirrorwork tracker note stripe-staff-backend "System design round scheduled for Monday 2pm"
```

Output:
```
✓ Updated notes for stripe-staff-backend
```

## Auto-Update Integration

When a job is added via `/mirrorwork add job`:
1. After saving to `activity/jobs/{id}.json`
2. Add a row to `activity/tracker.md`
3. Default values:
   - Status: `saved`
   - Stage: `-`
   - Outcome: `-`
   - Notes: Based on fit verdict

**Row format:**
```
| {company} | {title} | {fit_score}% | saved | - | - | {verdict_summary} |
```

## Notes

- Keep table sorted by status (interviewing → applied → saved → rejected)
- Track outcomes to identify patterns (e.g., failing at coding rounds)
